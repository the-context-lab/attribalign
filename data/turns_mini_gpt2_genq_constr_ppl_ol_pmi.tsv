Uh, there's an annual membership fee, uh, that's, that's fairly high.. Plus there's an initiation fee that you have to pay because of first time, uh, uh, member.. So the whole process can cost you a hundred fifty dollars to join the club.. Plus you have to pay for the, the ammunition in any tournaments that you would join in.
